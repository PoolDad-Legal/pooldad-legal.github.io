## Complementary Sections (Highlights for IONWALL)

### 1. **The Power of Passkeys & DIDs**
IONWALL champions passwordless future by making FIDO2 Passkeys the standard for authentication. Combined with IONID (Decentralized Identifiers), this gives you unparalleled security and control over your digital self, independent of any single platform.

### 2. **Reputation Engine: More Than Just a Score**
IONWALL's reputation is multi-faceted, considering financial behavior (`Score.Fin`), creative contributions (`Score.Create`), social interactions (`Score.Social`), and overall security posture. This holistic score is anchored on-chain for transparency and can be selectively presented via Verifiable Credentials.

### 3. **Open Policy Agent (OPA) & Rego: Programmable Trust**
At its core, IONWALL uses OPA and the Rego policy language. This allows for highly granular, auditable, and dynamically updatable access control rules that govern everything from simple data access to complex inter-agent operations.

### 4. **Immutable Audit Trail & Compliance**
Every policy decision, consent action, and significant reputation change is logged to a tamper-evident audit trail (ClickHouse + L2 Blockchain anchoring), providing verifiable proof for compliance (GDPR, LGPD) and dispute resolution.

### 5. **IONWALL & The IONVERSE Agent Protocol (IAP)**
IONWALL is a critical service provider within the IAP. Agent 000 and other IONFLUX agents query IONWALL via IAP for reputation scores, to evaluate policy for an intended action, or to request user consent for sensitive operations, ensuring all automated actions are aligned with user permissions and ecosystem trust standards.

### 6. **IONWALL Pricing & Access**
*   **Core Security & Identity:** Fundamental IONWALL features (Passkey auth, basic reputation, standard policy enforcement) are included for all IONVERSE users.
*   **Advanced Tiers/Add-ons (Conceptual):**
    *   **Enterprise Policies:** Workspaces requiring highly custom or complex OPA policy sets might have specific tiers.
    *   **Premium Audit & Compliance Services:** On-demand generation of detailed compliance reports or advanced security analytics.
    *   **Reputation-Enhanced Services:** Access to certain IONVERSE features or benefits might be tiered based on IONWALL reputation scores, implicitly creating value for maintaining a high score.
